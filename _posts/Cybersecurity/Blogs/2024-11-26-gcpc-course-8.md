## Modul 1

### Security mindset
The ability to evaluate risk and constantly seek out and identify the potential or actual breach of a system, application or data

### Classifying for safety
- **Public data**
	- **Public data** is already accessible to the public and poses a minimal risk to the organization if viewed or shared by others
- **Private data**
	- **Private data** is information that should be kept from the public. If an individual gains unauthorized access to private data, that event has the potential to pose a serious risk to an organization
- **Sensitive data**
	- This information must be protected from everyone who does not have authorized access. Unauthorized access to sensitive data can cause significant damage to an organization’s finances and reputation
- **Confidential data**
	- Confidential data often has limits on the number of people who have access to it. Access to confidential data sometimes involves the signing of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)— legal contracts that bind two or more parties to protect information—to further protect the confidentiality of the data

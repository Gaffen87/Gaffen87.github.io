## Modul 1+2

### Cybersecurity
The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

### Threat Actor
Any person or group who presents a security risk.

### SIEM tools
Security Information and Event Management tools used to monitor and analyze application or organisation security.

### CISSP Security domains

**Security and risk management:**
- Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and the law 
  
**Asset security:**
- Secures digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention and destruction of data.

**Security architecture and engineering:**
- Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems and processes are in place.

**Communication and network security:**
- Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communication.
  
**Identity and access management:**
- Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces and logical assets, such as networks and applications.

**Security assessment and testing:**
- Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities.

**Security operations:**
- Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

**Software development security:**
- Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.

## Modul 3

### Security Frameworks
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.
Purpose:
- Protecting PII (Personally identifiable information)
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weakness
- Managing organizational risks
- Aligning security with business goals

**Core components of security frameworks:**
1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

### Security lifecycle
Constantly evolving set of policies and standards.
## Security controls
Safeguards designes to reduce specific security risks

### CIA Triad
A foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

C - Confidentiality  
	Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
I - Integrity  
	Data is correct, authentic and reliable
A - Availability  
	Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it

### Asset
An item percieved as having value to an organization

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

### Security ethics
Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional

### Ethical principles in security
- Confidentiality
- Privacy protections
- Laws

## Modul 4

### Log
A record of events that occur within an organizations systems

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool
An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization
Examples of commonly used tools: Splunk, Chronicle

### Playbook
A manual that provides details about any operational action

### Network Protocal Analyzer (packet sniffer)
A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network
Examples: tcpdump, Wireshark

### Structured Query Language (SQL)
A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database

### Python
Used to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming, and that require a high level of detail and accuracy
